# WhiteWolf's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website portfolio! This website showcases my projects, skills, and experience in the field of Web Development. It was built using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Shadcn, Zod, and AceternityUI.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, providing improved developer tooling and catching errors early in development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly.
- **Framer Motion**: Framer Motion is a library for creating fluid animations and interactive UI components.
- **Shadcn**: A beautiful components library that works amazing with tailwind
- **Zod**: Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- **AceternityUI**: Another components library that has some more flashy components
